```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Workbook to investigate the question 1:

* Does a relationship exist between the nature of the crash and the crash severity in motorcycle accidents?

Questions:

* What is meant by the nature of the crash?  
* What is meant by the severity of the accident?  fatal vs non-fatal? but if so how do we do that since the dataset only seems to be for fatal accidents?
